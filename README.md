# Sexvergnügen Podcast Archive

This is a microsite that displays episode content from the german podcast "Sexvergnügen" by Ines Anioli and Leila Lowfire, which ran from 2016 to 2017. As of now there are 37 archived episodes of which I was able to recreate the content from various podcasting sites. This repository does not contain any actual audio files of the show.

The URL of the site is  
https://oelna.github.io/sexvergnuegen-podcast-archive

It displays a list of episodes and you're able to view details of the episode such as title, show notes, length and sample episode artwork.

In 2023, automatic episode transcripts created with the OpenAI Whisper (large) model were added. They are browsable as text and also play live when the web player is used.
